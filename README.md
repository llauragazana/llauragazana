<h1 align="center"> Hello, devs! Welcome to my GitHub profile!ðŸ‘‹ </h1>
My name is Laura (or just "Lau") and my nickname is llauragazanaâœ¨

ðŸ”­ I am currently an intern at the Institute of Mathematics and Computer Science (ICMC) of the University of SÃ£o Paulo. I work in the institute's communication area, creating notes and posts on ICMC's social networks and site, as well as publicizing events, workshops, courses and other university activities!
I study linguistics and literature in Portuguese and Spanish at UFSCar and participate in a research group in the field of NLP. Working at ICMC and doing research in computational linguistics, I got closer to the area of â€‹â€‹technology.

ðŸŒ± I am currently learning about developing documents, user guides and other written materials.

ðŸ‘¯ I'm looking to collaborate with translation and technical documentation
